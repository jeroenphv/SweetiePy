## Sucrose preference test

The sucrose preference test is one of the most widely used behavioral paradigms in neuroscience, measuring the relative preference of a 1-2% sucrose solution over water as a proxy for reward sensitivity in rodents. As such, a reduction in sucrose preference is interpreted as anhedonia, and used as evidence that animals exhibit ‘depression-like behavior’, for example after stress.

However, the sucrose preference test is a surprisingly complex behavioral test that involves several other cognitive processes, including learning and memory. As a result, a mere reduction in sucrose preference can also be indicative of other cognitive impairments, such as an inability of animals to learn from or memorize reward.


## Model fitting procedure

In an attempt to parse the different component processes subserving sucrose preference, we used a model fitting procedure in which we fit 14 different reinforcement learning models to the trial-by-trial choice behavior of the mice.

## The SweetiePy toolbox

The SweetiePy toolbox consists of a Jupyter notebook that guides you through the model fitting procedure in a step-by-step manner.
